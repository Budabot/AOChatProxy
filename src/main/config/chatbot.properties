# Note: in previous versions of AO Chat Proxy, you were required to configure
# both the master and slave bots in this file.  In this version, the master no
# longer needs to be configured in this file--only the slave bots needs to be
# configured.  It will not work if you configure the master bot as one of the
# slave bots.  To add more slave bots, simply add another config section
# with consecutive numbers (eg. 2, 3, 4...).
